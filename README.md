## Homework (Part  1)

My name is Merel and I study **Computational Biology and Bioinformatics** at the _ETH Zurich_. I completed my bachelor's degree in Amsterdam, at the _Amsterdam University College_. I majored in biology and chemistry. During my internship at _AMOLF_, a biophysical research institute in Amsterdam, I learned programming in Python and C. I'm very excited for my new adventure in Zurich. You can find more information about me on [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/merel-kuijs-2462a69b/).
